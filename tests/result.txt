creation, Pairit’s architecture is extensible to diverse domains, such as software development (e.g.,
AI generating code while humans debug), scientific writing (e.g., AI drafting literature reviews), or
multimedia content production (e.g., designing virtual reality environments). This versatility allows
researchers to explore human-AI collaboration in tasks requiring varied cognitive and creative skills,
addressing a gap in prior studies that often limit AI to text-based functions (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023).
For example, a future study could use Pairit to analyze how AI agents assist in architectural planning,
tracking both textual specifications and visual renderings to assess collaborative efficiency and
output quality. By capturing multimodal interactions, Pairit provides a comprehensive framework for
studying the interplay of different task components, a methodological leap forward for understanding
complex workflows.
These methodological contributions have broader implications for experimental research and
organizational practice. Pairit’s ability to simulate realistic collaborative environments offers a
testing ground for refining theoretical models of human-AI interaction and informing the design
of AI-driven workflows. For instance, researchers could leverage the platform to study how AI
agents perform in agile software development sprints, using time-stamped data to optimize task
assignments and evaluate productivity trade-offs. Ultimately, Pairit’s methodological innovations

bridge the gap between controlled experiments and real-world applications and provides a robust,
scalable framework for advancing our understanding of human-AI collaboration.
4.2 Limitations and future directions
Limitations. While we conducted one of the first truly agent-randomized experiments in human-
AI collaboration, combining laboratory and field tests, on a newly developed platform capable of
recording fine-grained collaboration dynamics, our work is not without limitations. First, while we

organizations should invest in training programs that teach employees how to delegate tasks to
AI effectively, fostering a collaborative culture that maximizes both technological and human
contributions.
Finally, the study underscores the importance of aligning AI deployment with organizational
goals and team dynamics. The comparable team-level productivity between human-AI and human-
human teams, despite human-AI teams having half the human resources, suggests that AI can serve
as a near-substitute for additional personnel in certain contexts. Managers could use this insight to
scale team output without proportionally increasing headcount, a cost-effective strategy for startups
or resource-constrained firms. However, they must remain mindful of the social dynamics altered

by AI integration. The decrease in social and emotional messages in human-AI teams indicates less
time spent on rapport-building, which could impact team cohesion in long-term projects. Managers
should monitor team morale and consider hybrid models—such as combining AI assistance with
periodic human-human collaboration—to maintain a balance between efficiency and interpersonal
connection.
Methodological implications. This study advances the methodological landscape for studying
human-AI collaboration through the development of the Pairit platform, a novel experimental
framework that redefines how researchers investigate team dynamics in real-time, task-driven
settings. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on aggregate performance metrics or isolated
AI interactions (Noy and Zhang, 2023; Dell’Acqua et al., 2023), Pairit captures granular, time-
stamped data on every keystroke, message, edit, and API call, enabling a detailed reconstruction
of collaborative workflows. In our experiment, this capability allowed us to analyze 183,691
messages, 1,960,095 text edits, and 63,656 image edits, revealing nuanced patterns such as how
AI-driven suggestions shifted human effort from direct text editing to instructional messaging.

human-AI teams in the visual dimensions of ad creation and leading to human-AI teams creating
lower-rated images. These differences in collaboration outcomes indicate a shift in workload that
allowed human participants in human-AI teams to engage more in content generation with less
social coordination, like rapport building, than humans in human-human teams.
These communication, collaboration, and work process changes then translated into measurable
differences in productivity and performance. Humans in human-AI teams experienced 73% greater
productivity per worker and human evaluations scored the ads created by human-AI teams higher on
text quality but lower on image quality. AI evaluations scored the ads created by human-AI teams
higher on text quality and equally on image quality. Field tests of the ad campaigns revealed that ads
with higher image quality (produced more often by human collaborations) and higher text quality
(produced more often by human-AI collaborations) performed significantly better on click-through
rates, view through duration and cost per click metrics. As human-AI teams produced higher quality
text and lower quality images, human-AI ads performed similarly to those created by human-human
teams overall. Together, these results suggest that human collaboration with AI agents significantly
reshapes communication patterns and work processes and increases productivity, while improving
some dimensions of output quality and deteriorating others.
Although prior studies have shown that AI tools can improve productivity and reduce task
completion times (Noy and Zhang, 2023; Brynjolfsson et al., 2023), AI is often treated as a passive
tool rather than as an active collaborator. As AI agents become integral to modern workflows,
researchers are beginning to explore their role as work collaborators, rather than mere tools,
